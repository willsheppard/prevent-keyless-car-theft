## Explanation

Most of us leave our car keys in the hallway of our house which is a short distance away from our car. Thieves use special equipment to boost the signal from your car's keyless entry fob so the signal can reach all the way to your car and unlock it. They can even do this if you keep your keys in a room on the opposite side of your house.

A common solution is to keep your keys in a specially designed "Faraday box" or pouch which blocks the signal, but this doesn't work well for many. You could forget to put the keys there, or not want to spend the time and money. Pouches can also fail to work after some time. People have tried using tin foil instead, but it's still a bit of a faff.

There are other more elaborate devices to solve the problem, but they often carry a significant cost.

This page explains the official methods that your car manufacturer designed to prevent thieves carrying out signal boosting to steal your car.

### Types of disabling

This page describes, for each car type, up to three different ways to disable the keyless entry feature:

1. **Temporarily disable**. This is most useful if you want to use the keyless entry when convenient to you, but turn it off overnight or when you go on holiday. You have to remember to do it each evening. Keyless entry will stay deactivated until you next unlock the car by physically pressing the button on the key fob.
2. **Automatically disable**. This is the best option, because you don't need to do anything different to keep your car safe. They key fob turns itself off after you put it down. When you pick it up and put in your pocket, it reactivates. Unfortunately not all car manufacturers have provided this feature.
3. **Permanently disable**. Follow these instructions if you never want to use keyless entry. It protects the vehicle from _this specific type_ of keyless entry theft.

## Other methods of preventing car theft

- Put your keys in a little bag that blocks the signals called a "[Faraday pouch](https://www.google.com/search?q=Faraday+Pouch)". Not recommended, because in my experience these degrade over time and let signals through.
- Keep the keys on the other side of the house, far away from the car. Not recommended, because the signal can still be relayed with the right equipment.
- Put your keys in the microwave (Not tested. Has anyone tried this?)
- Permanently disable keyless entry (AKA passive entry). Often possible from the car's on-board touch-screen computer. Check the manual or ask your car dealer.
- Electronic immobiliser. All cars since 1998 already have a factory-fitted electronic immobiliser([*](https://www.mustard.co.uk/car-insurance/guides/what-is-an-immobiliser/)), but these are ineffective against relay attacks because the car's system has been tricked into thinking the correct key is present.
- [Ghost immobiliser](https://ghostinstallations.co.uk/). May protect against keyless car theft by providing an extra layer of security. Significant cost of installation.
- Thatcham mechanical wheel lock. A good idea if you can tolerate the inconvenience. Will definitely make your car more difficult to steal, whether by relay attack or any other method.
- Disable or lock the [data port](https://revolar.com/what-is-a-data-port-lock). Modern cars have electronic systems which are accessed via an "On-Board Diagnostics" (OBD) port. After gaining physical access to the vehicle, it is possible for thieves to plug equipment into the ODB port and hack the information neeed to start the car.
- Fit a tracker. Does not actually prevent the car being stolen, it's more of a deterrent (if the thieves are aware of it). Not ideal as you might have to travel quite a distance to reach the car's new location. It could be still be inaccessible or dangerous to approach. And a shipping container or even a car park might block the tracker signal.

## Reassurances

- Even when "keyless" or "passive" entry is disabled, it's still common to press a button on they key fob to unlock the door. You probably **don't** need to worry about the risk of thieves capturing **that** signal and replaying it later to steal your car. Firstly the signal is different for locking and unlocking the car. When you lock the car and leave, copying that signal would only help someone **lock** the car again! And when you **unlock** the car it's because you're about to get into it and drive off, so any potential thieves would need to follow your car. That is a lot of effort to go to, and presumably car theft most commonly occurs in low-effort, low-risk scenarios.
- A number of manufacturers have introduced preventative measures aimed at curbing keyless car theft. Fobs provided by car companies such as BMW, Audi, Ford and Mercedes now come fitted with a motion sensor that automatically deactivates the signal when the key is not moving; this prevents the signal being relayed when the key is left overnight, for example. Jaguar and Land Rover, meanwhile, use ultra wide-band radio technology, which stops thieves being able to isolate the signal to your car.
